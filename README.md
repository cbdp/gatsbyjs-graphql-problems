# gatsbyjs-graphql-problems

Why isn't my graphql query returning images?

Issue is described in more detail [here](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/20829).

Any help is appreciated, been trying to untie this knot for a long time now.

February 5th 2020: Setup a new branch (graphql-triage) with changes proposed. See issue link above for further explanation.
